- Blazor (for .NET-native full-stack)

### ✅ Cloud & DevOps
- **Azure Fundamentals** (or AWS)
  - App Services, Azure Functions, Key Vault, Event Grid
  - Azure DevOps CI/CD pipelines
- **Docker & Kubernetes** basics
- IaC tools: Bicep or Terraform (basic level)

### 📚 Resources
- MS Learn: Azure + DevOps Paths
- Book: *Architecting Cloud-Native .NET Apps for Azure*

---

## 🧠 PHASE 4: System Design & Scalability
**Goal:** Architect high-scale, maintainable, and resilient systems.

### ✅ Focus Areas
- **Microservices Architecture**
  - Service discovery, API Gateway, Fault tolerance (Polly)
- **Monolith vs Microservices Trade-offs**
- **Database Design for Scalability**
  - Sharding, Partitioning, Caching strategies (Redis)
- **Messaging & Eventing**
  - RabbitMQ, Azure Service Bus, Kafka (basics)
- **Observability**
  - Logging (Serilog, Seq), Monitoring (App Insights), Tracing

### 🎯 Exercises
- Design a high-level architecture for:
  - E-commerce Platform
  - Hospital Management System
  - IoT-enabled Real-time Dashboard

### 📚 Resources
- Book: *The Art of Scalability*
- YouTube: GOTO Conferences, InfoQ, Microsoft Architect Talks

---

## 💼 PHASE 5: Leadership, Communication & Soft Skills
**Goal:** Transition from coder to decision-maker and technical leader.

### ✅ Must-Have Soft Skills
- Technical documentation and architectural diagrams (use C4 model)
- Leading code/design reviews
- Mentoring junior developers
- Communicating with non-technical stakeholders
- Negotiating trade-offs in architecture

### 🛠️ Tools
- Draw.io / Lucidchart for diagrams
- Miro for collaborative whiteboarding

---

## 🧪 PHASE 6: Certification & Portfolio
**Goal:** Validate and showcase your skills.

### 🎓 Suggested Certifications
- **Microsoft Certified: Azure Solutions Architect Expert**
- **Microsoft Certified: DevOps Engineer Expert**
- Optional: TOGAF (Enterprise Architecture)

### 📁 Build an Architect Portfolio
- Create GitHub projects with:
  - Clean Architecture
  - Microservices (with API Gateway, Service Bus)
  - CI/CD pipelines
  - Terraform scripts for Azure deployment
- Write case studies or blog posts about architectural decisions

---

## 🧭 PHASE 7: Real-world Experience & Transition
**Goal:** Start taking up architectural responsibilities in your current or next role.

### ✅ Action Plan
- Volunteer for architecture-related tasks (design, tech stack evaluation)
- Move into roles like:
  - Lead Developer
  - Technical Lead
  - Solution Designer
- Start attending architecture meetings & contributing
- Mentor junior developers to build your leadership profile
